# Description of standard queries

**NOTE:** For details of the properties,
see descriptions in the [ontology](../OKH-LOSH.ttl).

## \[I\] information queries

### i01 available information

return all data fields of a specific MOSH

## \[F\] filter queries

### f01 technology field

- find or exclude MOSHs with specific `patentClass` (multiple)

### f02 use case

for MOSHs:

- search for keywords in `function` (free text)
- filter for specific
  - `standard`
  - `projectStage`
  - `attestation` (boolean: is-empty)
  - `certificate` (boolean: is-empty)
- Option 1: filter for specific `patentClass` &/ `tsdcID`
- Option 2: filter for copyleft-categories of licenses
  by calling a sub-library with `spdxLicense`

### f03 language

- find or exclude MOSHs with specific IETF language tag (`language`) (multiple)

### f04 variants

- return versions and forks of a MOSH

## \[A\] assessment queries

### a01 license compatibility

- Option 1: compare `spdxLicense` of a specific MOSH
  with a list of OSHWA-compliant licenses calling a sub-library

- Option 2: check compatibility of licenses of specific MOSHs
  by calling a sub-library with `spdxLicense`

### a02 documentation

<!-- TODO: change to â†’ return available documentation references -->

- check whether or not [full packaging](#p01-full-package)
  would include entries for
  - `okhv`
  - `name`
  - `repository`
  - `version`
  - `licensor`
  - `spdxLicense`
    - while checking for [OSHWA-compliance](#a01-license-compatibility)
  - `function`
  - `tsdcID`
  - design files (hence a `sBoM` is a prerequisiste)
    - `name`
    - `quantity`
    - for MOSHs included
      - `source`
      - `export`
    - for POSHs included
      - `source`
      - `export`
    - for STDs included
      - `stdReference`
    - for BUYs included
      - `buyReference`
- returns a boolean ("probably complete", "probably uncomplete")
  - add a report of what's missing in case one or more
    of the mentioned data fields are empty

### a03 file formats

<!-- TODO rephrase for okh:sourceFileFormat -->

for MOSHs:

- Variant 1:
  - return list of all `fileFormat` used in `source`
- Variant 2:
  - user input is a selection of software
  - get list of supported file formats of selected software from sub-library
  - check whether files linked as `source` contain a `fileFormat`
    that is _not_ part of this list
  - return boolean
    - add a list of POSHs/MOSHs including a unsupported `fileFormat`
      indicating the corresponding file (tree-like list)
- options for both variants:
  - Option 1: exclude the `source` of submodules
  - Option 2: include the `source` of submodules

### a04 dissemination

- get number of MOSHs that include a seleted component MOSH/POSH/STD/BUY
  in their `sBoM`
- Option 1: split number by `patentClass` of the MOSHs using the selected component
- Option 2: add a list
  (`name`, `version` and internal link to the crawled MOSHs turtle file, using the selected component)

## \[P\] packaging queries

## p01 full package

A package of a certain MOSH includes the following.

NOTE 1:
The query may give the option to load sub-modules (other included MOSHs)
or just link to them.
In case of loading them, naturally the same requirements apply as for any other MOSH.

NOTE 2:
Packages may be (most likely) incomplete.
Empty fields are gaps in the resulting package.

- general information
  - get version of metadata standard used
    - `okhv`
  - identification
    - `name`
    - `repository`
    - `version`
    - `forkOf`
    - `language`
  - legal
    - `licensor`
    - `spdxLicense`
    - `alternativeLicense`
  - development stage
    - `developmentStage`
    - `attestation`
    - `certificate`
  - basic description
    - `patentClass`
    - `tsdcID`
    - `standard`
    - `function`
    - `readme`
    - `image`
    - `functionalMetadata`
    - `productionMetadata`
- design files (=tree with links/references)
  - `name`
  - `quantity`
  - additionally:
    - MOSH (submodules)
      - `repository` & `version` when just referencing submodules
      - full package when loading submodules
    - POSH
      - `source`
      - `export`
    - STD
      - `stdReference`
    - BUY
      - `buyReference`

<!--- MOSH should be referenced as a release! not via repository & version -->

## p02 source package

= [p01 full package](#p01-full-package) without `export` fields
