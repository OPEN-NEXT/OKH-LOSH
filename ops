So each object or property has a unique, global identifier. when scraping data, we construct this identifier somehow out of the platform we found the project under, and the projects name. That is quite good, but in some cases, it could be desirable, to be able to define the name-space (==\u003e RDF base URL) manually. one obvious scenario would be to use a [PURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator), and thus be able to move the project from e.g. github to gitlab, without having the RDF namespace changed.","files":null}]}
