OKH suggests a 'manifest file' (see 4.3 [here](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/src/branch/master/1)) that is\n1. structured in compliance with the template in the standard\n2. located in the root folder of the repo (as required by the standard)\n3. named according to the method stated in the standard (`okh-thingname.yml`)\n4. stored in a certain file format (YAML in that case)\n\nI generally like this approach for it simple \u0026 effective nature, it appears stable and decentralised for me. However, some details:\n\n- stating the working title in the file name is\n  - redundant\n  - inconvenient for long working titles\n  - **→ I would cross out this requirement and keep the file name as short \u0026 intuitive as possible** …e.g. META-MOD for OSH modules or META-COM for components\n- using YAML as file format triggered a huge discussion in the group, which was never resolved (find a summary [here](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/issues/269))\n  - @hoijui any suggestions? Creating standard metadata shouldn't require any extra tool or knowledge and the content should be easily convertible into RDF/TTL by e.g. a crawler\n\n# The background\n\nJust created a new task within the new research project Open.Choice (still just a proposal ← the project, not the task). The project aims to enable decentralised production, maintenance and modification of COVID-19-related hardware. This metadata standard and the OSHI appear as important building blocks for that.","files":null}]}
