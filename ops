In practice, both makes sense, and while in the case of github.com and gitlab.com, it is possible to derive one from the other, that is not generally the case.\nSo the question is, should we have both (one property each?), or should we stick to one of the two (git clone URL, which protocol to be preferred?)\n\nexample Web:\n```\nrepo: \"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH/\"\n```\nThis can be put into the browser to see the repo.\n\nexample clone:\n```\nrepo: \"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH.git\"\n```\nThis can be used as `git clone https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH.git`.\n\n... as said, these two are very similar in this case, and one can derive one from the other, but that might not always be the case, an done also needs to first detect which one it is, and then possibly generate the other form, depending on which one needs.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1608546540,"nonce":"kVV6nxVp0iVT8pm8NMBMikOhSNs=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxMzUzNTM3MzU="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1608546540,"nonce":"iQ2+BK+n4lhLZWnm5U5BJTYkbEQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxMzUzNTM3MzY="},"added":["question"],"removed":[]},{"type":2,"timestamp":1608832312,"nonce":"PoWpP5LOS56zasrvQ+4N4tMV4vs=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDE0Nzg2NDE0Mg=="},"title":"okh:repository - Web-View or git (clone) URL?","was":"okh:repository - Web-View or git (clone) URL?"}]}
