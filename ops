The first/main file in each folder should have this name if possible, even if it is not a project or module.\n\nThe reason for that -- which I did not think of yesterday during the talk -- is that some protocols (most notably HTTP) do not allow fetching a list of all names, but only to fetch a specific file. there are workarounds for that, like many web-servers serving HTML based/formatted file listings when you try to fetch a directory that has no _index.html_, but that you have to parse first, and it is not always on, and may only work if there is no _index.html_, ...\n\nTo have a fixed file name, is also how it is done everywhere else I can think of right now:\n\n* `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n* `.travis-ci.yml`\n* `.htaccess`\n* `Makefile`\n* `CMakeLists.txt`\n* `.gitignore`\n* `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`\n* `index.html`\n\nThe later two are case-invariant, but I think they are only so because that was/is a windows bug aehh.. feature, which complicates things.","files":null}]}
