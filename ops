I do not think we should create a new kind of standard for these values, which needs users of our data to read more documentation and encode and decode from and to the values they actually want to have, which is not `technologyReadinessLevel = OTRL-4`, but `\"made\" = true`.\nIt is also a standard thing in Database normalization, to have one \"column\" per property, and not to combine multiple properties into one \"column\"/field.","files":null}]}
