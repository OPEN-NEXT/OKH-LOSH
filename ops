While for simple projects it is possible to share a CSV, complexer projects may require on-demand created or even interactive BoM's (such as LibreSolars MTTP or OpenFlexure). Or even simpler projects may just include a respective section in their README\n\nMy perspective: I think this issue occurs due to our limited view or ability to fetch \u0026 process this information. We try to press everything into linkable files, but reality has shown to be different. I wouldn't enforce a format in the specification, just because it's otherwise hard for us to fetch the information. Projects have their specific needs and hence also BoM-concepts.\n\nSo I personally would be fine just referencing the information in whichever form it may be provided","files":null}]}
