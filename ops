It is supposed ot work for JSON and YAML files, and I *hope* it also works for TOML.\n\nOur OKH JSON Schemas are currently at:\n\n*  [okh-v1.schema.json](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH-OKH-JSON-Schemas/blob/master/okh-v1.schema.json)\n*  [okh-losh.schema.json](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH-OKH-JSON-Schemas/blob/master/okh-losh.schema.json)","files":null}]}
