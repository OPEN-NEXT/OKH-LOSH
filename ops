The docu says almost nothing about the intended usage, only:\n\n    \u003e openSCAD primitive describing shape and size of the module\n\nbut:\n\n2. Is this required to be concave?\n3. Are any shapes possible?\n4. What is the intended use? - Because of the uses I can imagine, we would want something much more restrictive.\n5. We need to document the intended use and the limitations, for the field to become practically useful.\n\nAs it is now, the only way I can see how it could be useful, is:\n\nI would have to wrote special code that understand arbitrary OpenSCAD code, then renders a bounding-box around it (in the most efficient/smallest way possible -\u003e also not trivial!), and then uses that bounding box for checking the required working area of a 3D-printer or CNC machine or the like, required to produce the piece, or to have an idea of packaging/storage requirements for the piece.\n\n-\u003e not practically viable\n\nFor rendering or other kind of .. more dept/detailed analysis or simulations, we would want the actual shape, not the outer dimensions.\n\nAn other issue is, that I can imagine to be able to relatively easily export a bounding box from various softwares/models, but any OpenSCAD code generation from anything not directly OpenSCAD would naturally be very limited (possibly to a bounding box) anyway,\nwithout the benefit on the parsing/consuming side of the data, to be able to rely on that.","files":null}]}
