I think it would be the best solution, and I find it hard to believe that nobody did it yet. The question is just, who and where is it!\n\n... And of course, this would have to be found out for each platform separately.\nThus it might make sense to do a brute force, HTTP/HTML based crawler that works on all platforms, and try to do this more eloquent and efficient approach just for github and gitlab at first.","files":null}]}
