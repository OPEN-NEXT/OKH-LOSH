More specifically: \n\n**Which questions should it be able to answer?**\n\nImagine you hear for the first time about a graph database which connects OSH Modules (which makes a powerful filter for OSH) and is also capable to cross-reference information from other domains (e.g. ongoing COVID-19 research)\\\n**→ What are your expectations towards this knowledge base?**\\\n→ What would make it actually useful for your work?\n\n[This section in the README](https://github.com/open-next/oshi#tldr-qa) gives a rough overview of what is covered by the current ontology draft. However, don't feel limited by that. Also no need to read into anything else. Just list your thoughts and wishes and I'll translate this into technical constraints for the ontology and the crawler.\n\nThanks!\\\nI hope indeed that this knowledge base will support your (and so many other's) work in the field of OSH.","files":null}]}
