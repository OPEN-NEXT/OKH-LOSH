Such like Github does it for licensing terms (see screenshot below): no one needs to know these licenses by heart in order to understand their core requirements. So for OTRL/ODRL we could just use Table 2 \u0026 3 from the publication.\n\n![image](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/assets/45949491/d48bdf86-2ad7-4fe0-887f-fe04355467d4)\n\nHowever, it comes down to the question whether we want to use them in the first place. I didn't want to create yet the next arbitrary scale for technology readiness (but somehow did by the publication; just with a little more research and logic behind it), such as PubInv or the OSHWA technology categorization system.\n\nI guess it makes sense to stick to universal terms that people are familiar with already from other platforms.\n\ne.g.\n\n- from the technology side: stage of development (idea/prototype/product)\n- from the documentation side: stage of documentation (quite holey/partly complete/DIN SPEC compliant)\n\n(which is again quite similar to the OTRL/ODRL scales)\n\nThe \"algorithms\" that you quoted where an attempt to automatically assign certain levels to projects. So if \"made\" is true, this usually means that the technology can be used in practice","files":null}]}
