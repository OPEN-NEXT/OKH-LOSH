This however seems a) to fall rather under the umbrella of @penyuan 's work (although he's focused on GitHub) and b) to be a fairly intense, yet optional task. I propose we build a working version first and keep this as an optional extension of our work. This is surely a cool feature. Once we have a v1.0 published we'll see if developing it is worth the effort (or if e.g. @penyuan already took care of it in the meantime)\n\nâ†’ so:\n\n- no reconciliation needed\n- knowing the licensor is essential (legal information), knowing that two different licensor identities are the same person is optional\n\nSeems that this issue can be closed now; if anything remained unanswered, please reopen it again.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1607944985,"nonce":"U3d+AnN39KoM6baGmnMJJyviaiQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEwODY5NjQ1MA=="},"status":2}]}
