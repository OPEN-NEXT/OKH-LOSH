I also don't have and in depth understanding of the MOSH POSH file structure. But here goes:\n\n* There will never be a CSV file that captures all BOMs. BOMS are hierarchical and must extensible for new circumstances. I would choose a format like JSON, YAML, TOML, even maybe XML (except I hate XML). This way you can create an extensible schema.\n* You can have technology specific CSVs which can be shaped into the more general hierarchical schema for people that like CSVs that sit in an easy an well defined area.\n* Requiring too much information at the outset in a barrier to entry. If a CSV of `name, qty, link` can work, but give you a low \"completeness\" score, they you get people online and you have a carrot for them to work their way up the search results.\n* From a [GitBuilding](https://gitbuilding.io) perspective this allows me to generate a BOM on the fly and put as much meta data as I have into the correct from for the crawler. It would be important in this case to not require that the BOM is in the repository, as it would be generated automatically and would available on a generated webpage.\n\n---\n As an example of why the schema should be hierarchical is that for a white LED it is pretty important that I can specify things like:\n * Viewing angle\n * Colour temperature\n * Current rating\n * Package type\n\nCapturing this in the BOM so it can be compared to other components to assess local availability would be great. Some of these apply well to other electronic components, others less well. None of them make much sense if I am speccing a wing nut.","files":null}]}
