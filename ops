Or is there a better way I can describe the data model to you? The thing is, the dashboard's metadata needs are likely to change especially after we deliver the month-18 deliverable, which is the minimal version I previously described to you:\n\nhttps://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/M18.svg\n\nAfter that, we hope to build more sophisticated/interesting components like these, and they might require more metadata to be mined from the repos on GitHub and WF:\n\nhttps://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/network_viz.svg\nhttps://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/low_hanging_fruits.svg\nhttps://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/archetypes.svg","files":null}]}
