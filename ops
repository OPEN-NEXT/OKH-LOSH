People are interested in confidence/project state first and foremost and it's yet very hard to get reliable data about that just from the repository.\n\nI also want to avoid unnecessary additional data fields. So for me this boils down to one new field, called \n\n#### confidence/testing/intended use (or anything like that)\n\n5 in decentralised mass-production (e.g. valid CE-certification) (e.g. Arduino)\n4 in prototype production; stable \u0026 tested design, has been replicated many times without any involvement form our side; use at your own risk! (e.g. MNT Reform)\n3 decentralised prototyping; other enthusiasts built and tested this (e.g. COSI Measure)\n2 prototyping stage, I built _and_ tested this\n1 development stage, no one has actually built this yet\n0 idea stage\n\nother things like openness, maintenance/activity can be assessed from other data (contribution guide, number of maintainers \u0026 contributors, commit history vs. issue history etc.)\n\n---\n\nA very interesting question is also the funding model behind a project e.g.\n\nfunded by public money\nventure capital\ndonations/crowdfunding\n100 % free time project\n\nâ€¦so what's behind this. It often explains the dynamic of a project. But this is way too early to implement it as a new data field.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1598297401,"nonce":"fCu7kAAC3tKxvxGy+z6YUT2bt7U=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzY4NjkxMTQ1NA=="},"added":[],"removed":["idea status"]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1598297401,"nonce":"ZLDamPPlhEBcChCIaKs6utNXRos=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM2ODY5MTE0NTY="},"added":["staged for decision"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"timestamp":1611671677,"nonce":"SdzD6HRphX7Iw0ko8bg6/+FAVVw=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NzU4MTQ5NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/14#issuecomment-767581495"},"message":"very interesting, but too much for this project and with high risk not to be maintained in manifest files.
