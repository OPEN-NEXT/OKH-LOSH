The specific challenge/benefit we have with hardware is that there are no widespread metadata concepts existent yet that we could compare and build on.\nThere's\n\n- open know-how (as linked in the README)\n- individual API data from various platforms (as OSHWA certification list etc.)\n\nSo our approach is to improve the open know-how specification and map the data available via APIs of various OSH platforms onto it.\n\nAnyway, I'll definitely mention this project in the report for the EU :)","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1612780603,"nonce":"7d1wOs8R8ImlO/2Chtdt0Smr4vw=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQzMDI2NDA4MTM="},"added":["Report"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"timestamp":1612780604,"nonce":"pB8yhXL7ZNlAQ1Svw+hKiDAGuSs=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDMwMjY0MDg4Ng=="},"status":2}]}
