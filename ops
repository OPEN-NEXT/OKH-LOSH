To follow our metadata specification, people are forced to either adopt to the sBoM template in regards of their own BoM or to produce redundant information in case they already have a BoM.\n\n---\n\nSuggested solution:\n\nThe important part is that all relevant information is accessible. \n\n- This can be done in MOSH \u0026 POSH files.\n- A MOSH file contains then \n  - URL to the BoM\n  - URLs to POSH files\n  - URLs to MOSH releases/snapshots \n- POSH files remain unchanged\n\nNext step (after OPEN!NEXT, I presume) would be to standardise BoMs for OSH (and likewise other reoccurring parts of the documentation like README). And _this_ seems like a bigger issue and may even turn out to be unsolvable at the moment as this stuff seems to be technology- and even target-group-specific.","files":null}]}
