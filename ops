Please don't apologise for questions, suggestions or critique; it's an open source process and every bit (especially from skilled/knowledgeable people) is valuable. + I don't expect people to be always totally up to date with all ongoing discussions â†’ it's simply too much sometimes, so let's just ask and support each other\n2. yes, we/I meant the turtle format\n3. yes, I totally agree about relying on a simple, intuitive way to provide this data. I won't expect from any OSH project to read into TTL so they can 'become part of our network'. No one will do that. However, _we_ may want to use TTL in our database. Input from other file formats (hereinafter called 'distributed format') may get converted by our crawler into the actual input format so we can effectively use it in the Wikibase instance\n4. MD could be indeed another option for a distributed format, if we can provide a reasonable template\n5. the distributed format should be human-readable, the input format doesn't need to be as it's content is a) identical with the distributed format and b) can be queried by the Wikibase instance","files":null}]}
