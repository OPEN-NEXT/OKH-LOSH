From my naive perspective of very limited coding experience I assume that this is possible Independently from the file format (as I could just place a link in a YAML file).\n\nMy suggestion based on your input:\n\n1. support a list of formats (e.g. TTL, TOML, YAML \u0026 JSON)\n2. convert all crawled files into TTL; for wikibase we'll use TTL only\n3. (optional, but recommended): provide a tool to generate the files (GUI/TUI/CLI); this tool will output TTLs, of course\n\n→ for me that's (almost) enough to take a decision in our next meeting.\n\n@hoijui any suggestions for widely accepted file formats that wouldn't be too much effort to convert to TTL when following a standard structure/template?
