They are parts of the Open!Next project to which this repository belongs. WP stands for \"work package.\"\n\nI am responsible for WP2.2 which is for creating an online-accessible dashboard that shows metrics for open source hardware projects hosted on version control platforms such as GitHub, Wikifactory, and I hope others like GitLab. I've talked to @moedn about integrating WP2.2 with the Wikibase instance and the crawler.\n\nFor example, the dashboard is supposed to have a data-mining script that pulls data from those repositories to show. One way to do this is to integrate this functionality into a module of the crawler. This data can be stored in the Wikibase instance for the dashboard to access.\n\nTo allow such access, presumably the Wikibase instance will have a data access API. So my question was asking how this API will be design, what the interface will look like and if authentication is required.","files":null}]}
