You can later change where they link to.\nSo when your project is on github you can link to there, and if you later move to gitlab, you can just change that aliases link target. This way, the URL a file/dir is available under can stay the same over time, with things changeing.\nIt also allows you to worry less about which hosting provider you use, for example.\n\nthe internet archive is just one (maybe the most used and trustworthy) provider of such a service.\n\nas I get it, this issue is not about storing data at the internet archive, but just about registering a PURL.","files":null}]}
