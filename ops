Sorry I didn't follow all of it so it might have already been discussed, but:\n\nFrom my experience it is useful to ease entry and onboarding, especially if one of our aims is to *promote* open source hardware. To that end, I think it would be good to use a file format that is more human-readable and easy to understand at-a-glance. An extreme example is that Markdown is much easier for a human to parse than dense HTML or even LaTeX.\n\nI certainly don't think Markdown is the format to use in this case, but of the options already presented, is there one that is more human-readable? Is this factor worth considering? (honest question)","files":null}]}
