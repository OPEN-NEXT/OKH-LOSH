I know what I'm doing.\nI+   I had to adopt the design a bit over time.\nI    I tried to avoid security bugs while writing this.\nI-   Look, they paid me to do this.\nI--  The guy left. Code now maintained by team in India.\n!I I have no idea what I'm doing.\n```\n\nI felt this comes close to a decentralised Open-O-Meter approach and could be applied to hardware modules. Especially the level of profession that flew into a machine or how well/active it is maintained are factors generally hard to assess when just looking on the source files. Also judging from commit frequencies etc. can be misleading. When was the last update/commit for the hexagon screw?\n\nAnd yes, we may want to choose a less geeky way to communicate these properties :)","files":null}]}
