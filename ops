I work with @hoijui on the FabCity Interfacer project, and work on the [Valueflows](https://valueflo.ws) ontology. Robin asked me to comment here, one question being the English names.  I'm a native English speaker, and have lots of data modeling experience, but I am not a maker.  And Valueflows is expressed in rdf, so I have studied it a lot, but I have never actually developed with rdf, and feel I have some practical gaps.  So we will see, and I won't be insulted in the least if you disregard my thoughts. :)\n\nNames:\n* Component - To me this implies not being a final \"product\" that can be used on its own.  It is more like a \"part\".  Here's a dictionary definition: \"A part of a mechanical or electrical system.\"  (Note the name \"product\" I don't like either, it implies something that will be sold more than something that will be used.  I can help look for a better one if you want one.)\n* Module - I am more familiar with this in software, where it is also more like a part, and implies it can be used as part of different software applications.  Dictionary definition: \"a separable component, frequently one that is interchangeable with others, for assembly into units of differing size, complexity, or function.\"\n* Part - Yes, a part.  Dictionary definition: \"a portion or division of a whole that is separate or distinct; piece, fragment, fraction, or section\".\n\nOne bigger thought on naming:  OKH-LOSH doesn't actually represent any of the above, if you are coming in from the bigger picture.  It represents designs for those things, not the already built things themselves.  Or for the things you always just buy, like screws, it represents the exactly defined \"type\", not the actual thing.  To me, it is important to situate your ontology in the rest of the world, and not make assumptions that people already know it is all about designs.\n\nAnother thought, about separating your Modules and Parts.  It makes sense that makers now always use \"commodity\" parts like screws that can be ordered from AliBaba, or bought from the hardware store down the street who got them from AliBaba.  But in the future, if we look towards more and more localization of production, those distinctions might disappear more and more.  Maybe some day there is a small factory in your town that makes screws, and has its own BoM for inputs to those, and is part of your maker network instead of outside it.  Maybe some day it goes all the way back to mining the ore.  Or not, I don't know how you think about it.\n\nQuestions that affect naming:\n1.  I guess this is always about hardware?  Do you ever include things like textiles?  (I noticed in FabCity and in our own (sadly dead) local maker space, textile makers are part of it.)\n2. On the Software (subclass of Component) that is used in the hardware, is it also the design?  Or is the software actually already programmed and tested when you represent it in OKH-LOSH?","files":null}]}
