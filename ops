I just write stuff to document the process.\n\n`tags` I expect to be standard.\n`slots`... I confess, I made up myself. I did digress from `categories`, because with categories, multiple images can be in the same category, while each image would have at most 1 category. here though, we want the opposite: each \"slot\" can be filled at most once.\na thesaurus search for alternatives to \"slot\" (filtering out the obviously non-fitting), leads to:\n\n* slot\n* channel\n* position\n* slit\n* hole\n* socket\n\nI would consider `slot` or `socket` to be the best fitting.\n\nOthers must have the same requirements, and it should be possible to find what they use ...\n\nI wound the HTML element `\u003cslot\u003e`, which is basically a placeholder in an HTML element, supposed to be replaced with something else by some templating engine (some software):\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::slotted\n\nApart from the replacing, we have the same \"filling in (at most) once\" logic.","files":null}]}
