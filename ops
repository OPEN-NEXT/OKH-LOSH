however you may add whatever you like in this name (e.g. as suggested by `OKH-thingname`)\n2. the file name must start with a dot \".\" → e.g. `.okh.yml`\n3. the metadata file describing the whole module must be placed in the root directory; all metadata files for sub-modules or components may be placed in the corresponding folder so that they would be in the root directory if the module would be cloned into a individual repository; however as files are unambiguously referenced in the OSHM file, you can place them wherever you like","files":null}]}
