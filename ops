I just used this as a meta class\n\nregarding `module`: in mechanical engineering, this would be called a \"sub-assembly\". we wanted a term that is abstract enough to be understood in many domains. a `module` is essentially an assembly of parts, fulfilling a defined function. it is also possible (and encouraged) to reference external modules (e.g. RepRap's extruder design when developing your own 3D printer)\n\nregarding linking to other ontologies and the bigger context: I believe this gap came by the lack of experience we have in this field. definitely something worth fixing\n\nregarding alibaba: OKH-LOSH doesn't make any assumptions about how or where the parts of the design are obtained. standard parts are described by an official standard (as most screws; and therefore fungible), purchased components exist somewhere in the market (and may raise practical limitations when replicating the machine, depending where on earth you're located) and self-designed components are included in a repository. neither the BoM nor the references in the metatdata will replace the final shopping list (but will help to create it)\n\n--\n\nthanks for your feedback! generally, I'm not very attached to any of these structures or names. I have little to no experience with ontologies and we just did our best to construct something that makes sense and works for us. so feel very free to adjust it to your liking :) in that case I'd like to be kept in the loop to check the results against my engineering perspective and give feedback.","files":null},{"type":6,"timestamp":1676567844,"nonce":"8kQsH+cdbnKAD9rrrl9MIHdrq5E=","metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lALOD3p2KM5VcH-gzi1la1k"},"target":"7e7c8575764b97d95eabfcb4fe2faa485e6ee3fcbcafd9ead77ef95043842e2d","message":"Hey @fosterlynn ! nice to finally e-meet you :) sorry for the super late reply\n\nregarding your questions:\n\n1. \"hardware\" is a very flexible term here.
