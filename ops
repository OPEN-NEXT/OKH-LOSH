I think of it a bit like the main \"levels\"(?) in ValueFlows, there: Knowledge, Plan and Observation (so 3 levels in VF, 2 in our case):\n![](https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/process-layer.png)\n\nThese spheres are different, but for the most part - or at least roughly - an object in one sphere has an equivalent object in the other sphere.\n\n* e.g. a screw (\"available component\") in the physical sphere has a specification in the virtual sphere\n* a machine in the physical sphere has a design in the virtual sphere\n* an (indivisible) part or sub-assembly of the machine, has a (reusable-)design in the virtual sphere\n\nSome questions (mostly for myself and maybe discussions; numbered just to make them referenceable):\n\n1. Standard vs. Specification? (probably the later should be used primarily, and the former only for official/somehow approved specs)\n2. are physical\u0026virtual good words (for the two levels)? or maybe rather touchable\u0026untouchable? or touchable\u0026conceptual? or ...\n3. should we call these two \"levels\" or \"spheres\" or something else?\n4. is hardware something that is actually \"hard\", only? (or should we rather call it just _\u003cs\u003ehard\u003c/s\u003eware_?)\n5. ... or rather \"something you could potentially buy in a hardware store\"?\n6. could touchable be a good word to include hard things + textiles plus liquids?\n7. ... what about gas ... is it touchable? (I would say yes)\n8. do terms like _experiential_ or _tangible_ make sense for our ontology?\n    (that might include hard, soft and liquid things, but not most gases)\n9. Is that too philosophical already?\n10. some (one-piece) parts that are machined in a single go, thus being one part in the manufacturing process, may be broken off/split into multiple parts for the assembly process. Is this an indivisible part? how do we practically handle this ... do we need an other level/sphere, separating the physical one into manufacturing and assembly?\n11. ... would we need even more spheres, e.g. for recycling?\n12. How do we clearly and intuitively differentiate between a modular design (e.g. one part of a machine can be used as-is for an other machine as well) from a modular machine/touchable (e.g. the OSE US tractor, which - after being fully built, has a modular motor compartment, where one can place an electric motor or a gasoline-fulled one)?\n13. Should we setup the ontology in a way, where each individual is of class \"Something\"/Object (completely generic), and then specified through its properties: touchable, designed, specified, liquid, hard, likely-reusable, machined, standardized, a thing, whole, a piece, a part/component of something bigger, ...?\n14. Could we reuse ontologies from physics/chemistry? (researched a bit in early 2023, did not find anything useful)\n15. How do we deal with natural/grown parts (e.g. a branch from a tree)? -\u003e high variances, not specified, not fungible, no technical drawings or other exact specifications, ...\n16. Where do \"wet\" components fit in? (e.g. biological networks of neurons, mycelia)\n17. How do we include/specify/deal with the requirements of parts? (e.g. the conditions required to keep biological networks of neurons alive and/or functional)\n18. In english, there is a fixed expression: \"Is this really a thing?\" -\u003e can/should we make sure this makes sense within our ontology, as it is commonly understood? .. or better not?\n19 **How can/should we limit the scope of our ontology?**","files":null}]}
