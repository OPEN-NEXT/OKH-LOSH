And apparently people use them (not frequently, but still).\n\nA few thoughts on this:\n\n- custom input can serve as an experimental field; people can define fields themselves and query them without changing the ontology\n- frequently used custom fields can be included in later updates of the ontology\n- not sure how to integrate that in the ontology… ← any ideas? @hoijui","files":null}]}
