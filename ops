AFAIK there is currently no clear indication of `licensor` (there's only the equivalent of \"owner\" but that's not explicitly `licensor`) and the `license` is not SPDX-compliant not to mention there are inconsistencies. For example, the `CC0` license returned from the API has a \"license name\" of CC BY (or something like that), and the CERN licenses don't include 2.0. I can double check specifics but just FYI.","files":null}]}
