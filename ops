I think the specific format can be chosen in a quick chat between @ahane @hoijui and me (e.g. could be just additional fields in the TOML)\n\nThanks for your input! Things make a lot more sense now :)","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1614621103,"nonce":"RvU0qXGKAJz/xopuopBDELN39wA=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM5MTA0Njg5MQ=="},"status":2}]}
