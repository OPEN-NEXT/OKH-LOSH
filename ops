Even the metadata is locked into the issuing body's platform.\\\nAccording to DIN SPEC 3105-2 it's sufficient to link the reviewer discussion in the attestation. However, a core principle is that information shall be portable so that a conformity assessment body doesn't hold unnecessary power (e.g. via 'vendor lock-in').\\\nOn the other side I don't want to raise additional bureaucracy \u0026 constraints where not really needed.","files":null}]}
