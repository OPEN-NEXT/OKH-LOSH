As most of our projects are scraped form non-git based project-hosting websites, we would have to be able to scrape the email from there, which likely ... or even \"hopefully\" is not possible, as otherwise everyone would get spammed.\n\nSo we would have to check, if it is possible to get the project owner email on platforms:\n\n* [ ] github\n* [ ] gitlab.com\n* [ ] Thingiverse\n* [ ] Wikifactory\n* [ ] Appropedia.org\n\nIf not, we might need to provide a hosting-platform dependent way of contacting a user, which would be very ugly, as then each software wanting to contact a user, would have to implement support for all these means of contacting.","files":null}]}
