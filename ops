After all, the only thing we can upload on development platforms is the documentation of components. Even technical drawings often contain descriptions, specifications and instructions. But (usually) languages are not mixed in the same documents which means we can also have unambiguous references to those e.g. for packaging reasons (=a download button for the Japanese version of project [crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd))\n\nSo `okh:language` refers to the language the _documentation_ of a component is written in. This of course \n- only applies for `module` and `piece` â†’ so we should redefine `domain`,\n- should be noted in a `comment` to avoid confusion","files":null}]}
