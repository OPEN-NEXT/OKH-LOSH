Immediate and clear access to critical assets (CAD, BOM, Build instructions, Enabling Explanations) in open and editable formats. This already assumes that the license is vetted as DIN SPEC 3105/OSHWA compliant. Thus, the mechanism for vetting licenses must be clear.\n\n2. Active exclusion of projects that are not documented in open and editable formats (because this only causes waste of time and not true collaboration, and serves effectively only as marketing for the 'open source' entity and thus violates the integrity of the effort. This is critical for the database to gain authority and credibility)\n\n3. Contact and collaboration information - how to contribute or collaborate should be part of the submission process. It would also be nice to actively exclude projects that are not collaborative (no ways to participate in development or process), as open source without collaboration is not true to the open source ethic.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1596818748,"nonce":"ObreOrtaC9thZWWeyq0f+I9SFus=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDYwODE4OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-670608188"},"message":"Consider [this resource](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/Dashboard_Features.csv)","files":null},{"type":6,"timestamp":1596818772,"nonce":"zLaNHX4tUxbshn0c51XkGEBG1ao=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdElzc3VlQ29tbWVudEVkaXQ6MzkxNTc3MTUx"},"target":"8a3a2cbef95cf79da43a84629de9b948c69f24d2fd3592d620daf33e901a0889","message":"Consider [this resource](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.2_dev/blob/docs/docs/mockups/Dashboard_Features.csv)\\\n(open-next/wp2.2)","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1596985706,"nonce":"Wu8gRdcwv+FN4hYumgpwYgL/5Gw=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTA2MzM0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-671063340"},"message":"From Diderik:\n- focus on search engine\n- connect with wikimedia (commons)/wikidata","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1597330344,"nonce":"8mEkhx5KqJPt9ruBwLzb0zfx5GE=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzUyNTQ5MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-673525491"},"message":"automatic check for license compatibility when combining two different modules","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1597927935,"nonce":"FSEKW70YLJkC447IXxB1oF+w75M=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzY3NTA5NDUyNg=="},"added":[],"removed":["question"]},{"type":3,"timestamp":1598295384,"nonce":"jLPEd63UaSUQSsLGA0XZVYv2fc8=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTMwNTIzOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-679305238"},"message":"from the DIN SPEC / OHO community: shared metadata shall substitute a formal application for community-based assessment according to DIN SPEC 3105-2","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1598519245,"nonce":"aQD1Sw1isU0s2FPAT/SzZJ79LB4=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MTgyNDUzOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-681824539"},"message":"Julian: This is a great plan. I was wondering how much thought will go into grouping/deduplication of records. I am just worried that if every clone or fork of a big project, old versions, versions moved to other platforms, etc will start to swamp certain search results and make it unclear which is the core repo. However verifying which is the main repo is also hard. Not sure I have a good suggestion here except that it should be thought about.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1616402020,"nonce":"+lE4ck6AwAb1S2ZKFEE3JAWX7Yo=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzg3MDcyMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/15#issuecomment-803870721"},"message":"anonymous:\n\nMaybe LOSH could be useful for : \n* finding common parts between 2 systems\n* list all plastic or electric parts of a system\n* And whatever attribute or relationship you deemed useful when populating your metadata.","files":null}]}
