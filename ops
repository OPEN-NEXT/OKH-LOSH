This RDF is used as base for submitting the data to Wikibase. It also contains all identifiers (built from the raw data).\n\nThere is a [TTL](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH/blob/master/sample_data/okh-sample-OHLOOM.ttl) version of the TOML example you used that is meant to outline how data looks like in the end; it may answer some questions and clarify assumptions.\n\nSee e.g. the unique identifier in line 1: \n\n`@base             \u003chttps://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/ohloom/1.0.0#\u003e .`\n\nwhich is basically the repo URL + the assigned version of the piece of hardware.\n\nThe TTL is based on the [ontology](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH/blob/master/osh-metadata.ttl) (linked in line 2) which also defines data types etc. I can add the TOML keys there as comments if you like.\n\n---\n\nTo the questions:\n\n1. As you point out, the mapping shall be defined somewhere instead of relying on lookup functions. Happy to do that :) just let me know your preferred format\n2. We are using the repo URL to create identifiers for entities. Those URLs do not necessarily need to exist, just need to be unique. Parts could be referenced like that: `\u003chttps://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/ohloom/1.0.0/clampring\u003e`, referring to the clamp ring of OHLOOM v1.0.0 from OSEGermany on GitLab.\n3. `okh:Part` defines the class and is defined in the ontology which uses the prefix `okh` in the TTL\n4. files will be linked, images can be linked, too. In the end, all the data is already hosted somewhere, so no need to push everything to Wikibase. However, on the frontend side at least images should be available. So the image decision may depend on whether we're using a mediawiki-based frontend or any other platform and hence wikibase as a backend","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1621513456,"nonce":"Qr/onRd5n+ZNcfN4btYeNJKBSkw=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTA1NTg4MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/issues/98#issuecomment-845055880"},"message":"@lucaswerkmeister I struggle to imagine the consequences of this decision :)\nCould you provide a small example on what this would mean in practice?","files":null}]}
